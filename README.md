## Case of Study

### A little bit of Spanish Construction Sector History

There are several moments of history in which an explosion of the construction sector occurs. Those are mainly between the beginning of 60's, with a massive migration from the countryside to the city; and at the beginning of the 90's until the year 2008, when the big financial crisis begun.

### Final Energy Consumption by sector in Spain

The following data has been taken from [IDAE](http://guiaenergia.idae.es/el-consumo-energia-en-espana/)

| Sector                                 | %             |
| -------------------------------------- |--------------:|
| Transportation                         | 41,7          |
| Industry                               | 23,5          |
| Households                             | 18,5          |
| Services                               | 12,5          |
| Agriculture, phishing and others       | 3,8           |

As it can be seen above, households are directly responsible of an 18,5% of the final energy consumption. An if we take into account that Services includes commerce, hostelry, offices, health and education, we can come to realize how much energy the building sector consumes.

The Standard requiring builders to use isolation on the walls of buildings came into force in the year 1980[1](https://www.boe.es/buscar/doc.php?id=BOE-A-1979-24866). Until then, thermal isolation on the facade wasn't common.

This milestone represents a great opportunity today to address one of the main sectors when it comes to Carbon Dioxide emissions.

### Sant Boi de Llobregat

The City Hall of Sant Boi de Llobregat (Catalonia) asked to the Universitat Polit√®cnica de Catalunya for a study on the Energy Efficiency of buildings in certain districts of the town.

Buildings taken into account for the study are those which were built before 1980, according to the reasons given in the previous introduction.

Data were collected from more than 800 buildings. An exploratory analysis of the variables collected on the buildings is presented here.
